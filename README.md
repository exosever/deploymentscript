Deployment script for Pwnagotchi

This is my custom script I run for every pwnagotchi I deploy or re-flash. You can make adjustments to fit your needs, as it is tied to my custom config.toml with additional custom-plugin repos and faces.
Each section is outlined with an explanation, and you can easily choose if you don't want a certain feature ie; Don't want MITM tools with Airgeddon? comment it out.

I have also put my custon config.toml (sanitized) for those interested in how to get the full functionality of the script, and these are tied to my custom Miku face set. For more of my custom faces, and many others, check out https://github.com/roodriiigooo/PWNAGOTCHI-CUSTOM-FACES-MOD
